  This is the base class that third parties should extend when implementing a client-side extension that provides a
  custom list form (display, new, edit) for a SharePoint list.
remarks: ''
example: []

isDeprecated: false
type: class
properties:
  - name: context
    uid: '@microsoft/sp-listview-extensibility!BaseFormCustomizer#context:member'
    package: '@microsoft/sp-listview-extensibility!'
    fullName: context
    summary: Use the context object to access common services and state associated with the component.
    remarks: >-
      Child classes are expected to override this field by redeclaring it with a specialized type. It is meant to be a
      read-only property; the type cannot be declared as read-only in the base class (because it is initialized outside
      the constructor), but child classes should redeclare it as readonly.

    isPreview: false
    isDeprecated: false
    syntax:
      content: 'readonly context: FormCustomizerContext;'
