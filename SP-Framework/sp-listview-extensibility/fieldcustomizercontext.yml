      If the field customizer is bounded to the SharePoint list view, this provides access to the list view specific
      functionality; otherwise the value is undefined.
    remarks: >-
      Although the SharePoint list view is the main usage scenario, field customizers can be used by other user
      interface surfaces. For example, in the future SharePoint may support field customizers on a display/edit form.

    isPreview: false
    isDeprecated: false
    syntax:
      content: 'tryGetListView(): ListViewAccessor | undefined;'
