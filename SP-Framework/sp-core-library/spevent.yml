name: SPEvent
uid: '@microsoft/sp-core-library!SPEvent:class'
package: '@microsoft/sp-core-library!'
fullName: SPEvent
summary: Represents a framework event that components can subscribe to.
remarks: >-
  Examples of events in a web application might include: the user clicking a button, the system navigating to another
  page, or an item being added/removed from an abstract collection. The SharePoint Framework represents events using
  instances of the SPEvent object, one for each kind of event. The SPEvent object is typically exposed as a property of
  an associated class (e.g. the button that can be clicked). When a component is interested in an event, it calls add()
  to register an event handler callback that will be invoked each time the event occurs. The handler receives an
  SPEventArgs parameter that may provide additional details about what happened. This is analogous to the browser's
  Document Object Model (DOM) events. The main difference is the ISPEventObserver feature, which tracks which component
  subscribed to each event, and automatically unsubscribes the handler when the component is disposed.


  When an event is raised, all handlers are invoked synchronously. The order in which event handlers are called is
  unspecified. The event handler callback must catch any exceptions that occur during processing; an uncaught exception
  will not prevent other handlers from executing, but it will be reported as a problem with the associated component.


  The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or
  create subclasses that extend the `SPEvent` class.

    summary: Registers a callback that will be invoked whenever the event occurs.
    remarks: >-
      The same object can add multiple event handlers to the same event. Since BaseComponent implements the
      ISPEventObserver interface, a web part or extension can pass itself as the observer. This will cause the event
      handler to be automatically unsubscribed when the web part or extension is disposed.

            Indicates the object that is subscribing to the event: When the object is disposed, the event handler will
            be automatically removed. This object is also used for diagnostic purposes, e.g. detecting if the event
            handler failed to catch an exception.
