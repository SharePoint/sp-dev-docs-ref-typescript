name: RootServiceKey
uid: '@microsoft/sp-core-library!RootServiceKey:class'
package: '@microsoft/sp-core-library!'
fullName: RootServiceKey
summary: >-
  The RootServiceKey is a lookup key that is used when calling
  [ServiceScope.consume()](xref:@microsoft/sp-core-library!ServiceScope%23consume:member(1)) to fetch a dependency that
  is ever expected to only be created or provided once.
remarks: >-
  The lookup id for a RootServiceKey will be same as the name of the key, and every RootServiceKey will be placed at the
  root of a ServiceScope (ensuring that it will always be searchable within a ServiceScope). These are the only
  differences between a ServiceKey and a RootServiceKey.
