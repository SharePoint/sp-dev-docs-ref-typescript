summary: 'This is a [ServiceScope](xref:@microsoft/sp-core-library!ServiceScope:class) contract for reading the system clock.'
remarks: >-
  This interface abstracts the functionality of the system time APIs for usage with a
  [ServiceScope](xref:@microsoft/sp-core-library!ServiceScope:class)<!-- -->. For example, a unit test might replace the
  default [TimeProvider](xref:@microsoft/sp-core-library!TimeProvider:class) service with a mock implementation that
  follows a manually incremented timeline, in order to ensure that test failures are always repeatable.
