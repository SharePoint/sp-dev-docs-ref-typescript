summary: >-
  Used with the [SPEvent](xref:@microsoft/sp-core-library!SPEvent:class) system, this interface is implemented by
  components that can subscribe to events.
remarks: >-
  ISPEventObserver is an abstraction of the key features that a component must have in order to subscribe to a
  SharePoint Framework event: It must have instanceId and componentId information for diagnostics reporting, and it must
  have a way to notify the event system when the component is disposed, so that its handlers can be automatically
  removed. Other objects may implement this contract, as long as they meet these requirements.
