summary: >-
  This is a [ServiceScope](xref:@microsoft/sp-core-library!ServiceScope:class) contract for generating pseudorandom
  random numbers.
remarks: >-
  This interface abstracts the functionality of the system Math.random() API for usage with a
  [ServiceScope](xref:@microsoft/sp-core-library!ServiceScope:class)<!-- -->. For example, a unit test might replace the
  default [RandomNumberGenerator](xref:@microsoft/sp-core-library!RandomNumberGenerator:class) service with a mock
  implementation that always returns the same sequence of random numbers, in order to ensure that test failures are
  always repeatable.
