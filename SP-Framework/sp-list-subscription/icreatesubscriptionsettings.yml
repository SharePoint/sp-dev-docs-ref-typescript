  A list subscription requires at least a site ID and list ID. If the list is not contained in the root site of a web,
  you need to pass in the subweb id. If the domain you are accessing is different than the current domain, you will need
  to provide it as well.


  In the simple case (say a teamsite document library) in the current site, you can simply provide the library ID, and
  the current domain, site and web will be used.
