name: BaseComponent
uid: '@microsoft/sp-component-base!BaseComponent:class'
package: '@microsoft/sp-component-base!'
fullName: BaseComponent
summary: The base class for client-side components such as BaseClientSideWebPart or BaseExtension.
remarks: >-
  The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or
  create subclasses that extend the `BaseComponent` class.

  - name: componentId

    package: '@microsoft/sp-component-base!'
    fullName: componentId
    summary: Returns the component identifier as defined in the component’s associated manifest.
    remarks: >-
      Each client-side component has an associated manifest that is used by the sp-loader to load its scripts, and which
      may include additional metadata about the component. The manifest is uniquely identified using a text string
      containing a lower case GUID value.

    summary: Use the context object to access common services and state associated with the component.
    remarks: >-
      Child classes are expected to override this field by redeclaring it with a specialized type. It is meant to be a
      read-only property; the type cannot be declared as read-only in the base class (because it is initialized outside
      the constructor), but child classes should redeclare it as readonly.

    fullName: instanceId
    summary: A unique identifier for the instance of the component.
    remarks: >-
      A component implementation can be loaded multiple times on the page. For example, if the component is a charting
      web part, multiple instances of this web part could be added to the SharePoint canvas. The instanceId uniquely
      identifies each of these instances.

    summary: Disposes the component.
    remarks: >-
      Third-party code generally does not need to call this method; it's invoked automatically when the lifecycle ends
      for a web part or extension. To perform custom cleanup when your component is disposed, override the
      [BaseComponent.onDispose()](xref:@microsoft/sp-component-base!BaseComponent%23onDispose:member(1)) method.
