summary: Standard configurations for AadHttpClient.
remarks: >-
  This interface provides standard predefined AadHttpClientConfiguration objects for use with the AadHttpClient class.
  In general, clients should choose the latest available version number, which enables all the switches that are
  recommended for typical scenarios. (If new switches are introduced in the future, a new version number will be
  introduced, which ensures that existing code will continue to function the way it did at the time when it was tested.)

    summary: >-
      This configuration turns off every feature switch for AadHttpClient. The fetch() behavior will be essentially
      identical to the WHATWG standard API that is documented here: https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/
