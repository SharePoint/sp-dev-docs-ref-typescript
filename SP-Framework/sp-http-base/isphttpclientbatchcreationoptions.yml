      SPHttpClientBatch will need to perform its POST to an endpoint such as
      "http://example.com/sites/sample/\_api/$batch". Typically the SPWeb URL ("https://example.com/sites/sample" in
      this example) can be guessed by looking for a reserved URL segment such as "\_api" in the first URL passed to
      fetch(), but if not, the webUrl can be explicitly specified using this option.
