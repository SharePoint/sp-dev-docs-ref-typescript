    summary: Configure the SPWeb URL for authentication.
    remarks: >-
      For a write operation, SPHttpClient will automatically add the "X-RequestDigest" header, which may need to be
      fetched using a seperate request such as "https://example.com/sites/sample/\_api/contextinfo". Typically the SPWeb
      URL ("https://example.com/sites/sample" in this example) can be guessed by looking for a reserved URL segment such
      as "\_api" in the original REST query, however certain REST endpoints do not contain a reserved URL segment; in
      this case, the webUrl can be explicitly specified using this option.
