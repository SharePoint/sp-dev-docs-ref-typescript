    summary: An optional callback that will be invoked when the PlaceholderContent object is disposed.
    remarks: >-
      To avoid a resource leak, use this callback to free any resources that were allocated when the placeholder content
      was rendered. For example, if ReactDOM.render() was used to mount a React component, then the onDispose handler
      might call ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode() to unmount it.
