fullName: ApplicationAccessor
summary: Provides access to the client-side application that is currently running.
remarks: >-
  The client-side application determines the user experience for an entire web page. (It is a client-side component with
  a manifest; however, the SharePoint Framework does not enable third parties to create their own client-side
  applications at this time.) Within a web page, at most one client-side application will be running at a time. Certain
  in-place navigation transitions can cause the application to be unloaded and replaced by a different application.


  The ApplicationAccessor class enables extensibility components such as extensions and web parts to interact with the
  currently running application. It acts as a proxy for the real application object (the BaseApplication subclass), to
  ensure that extensibility components only rely on interactions that would be portable across all applications.

    remarks: >-
      Third parties should not call this constructor. Instead, use the ApplicationAccessor instance from the component
      context, for example
      [BaseApplicationCustomizer.context](xref:@microsoft/sp-application-base!BaseApplicationCustomizer%23context:member)<!--
