summary: >-
  The base class for implementing dialogs in SharePoint Framework. This provides
  a supported way for showing dialogs to the user inside SharePoint Framework
  components.
remarks: >-
  Extend this class to create dialogs for SharePoint Framework. By following the
  guidelines in implementation, the framework can ensure that the dialogs are
  shown in a user-friendly manner. While the content of the dialog is controlled
  by this class by implementing the render method, the framework can decide when
  to show the dialog and how to render the overlay and modal. The application on
  the page can also have control on allowing dialogs to show. Refer to the
  documentation of the individual methods and properties to learn more about how
  to extend and use this class.

    summary: Constructor for the `BaseDialog` class.
    remarks: >-
      It is important to keep the constructor lightweight. Use `onBeforeOpen()`
      for doing heavy-weight initialization that is needed for rendering the
      dialog such as resource allocations and asynchronous calls to fetch data.
      You can use the constructor to set initial parameters of your dialog such
      as references to resources in your application. The reason for this is
      that dialogs are usually constructed upon a UI event e.g. a button click,
      but the dialog may not always be shown right after construction. Keeping
      the constructor lightweight ensures smooth user experience and avoids
      doing throw-away work in case the dialog is not shown later e.g. if the
      framework rejects it. Another benefit of doing this is avoiding memory
      leaks by doing all the allocations and disposals in symmetric
      `onBeforeOpen()` and `onAfterClose()` events. If you allocate resources in
      the constructor, you have a memory leak because there is no guarantee
      onAfterClose() will get called, and onAfterClose() is your only
      opportunity to dispose.


      Example:


      ```
        constructor(cacheReference: any) {
          super();

          this._cache = cacheReference; // This is okay. Keeping a reference to my internal cache.
          this._cache.refresh(); // This is bad practice.
          // If you need to refresh the cache (or fetch data) for rendering, do it in onBeforeOpen()
        }

      ```

      The dialog lifecycle completes after closing and there should be no
      resources left inside the object. Even though the dialog may be revived
      again for a new lifecycle using show() method, this is considered a whole
      new lifecycle that should reallocate its own resources. If there are any
      resources that you would like to keep for multiple lifecycles, consider
      allocating it outside the dialog object and passing its reference to the
      dialog constructor.

    summary: Renders the contents of the dialog.
    remarks: >-
      The `render` method must be implemented to render the content of the
      dialog in the container element provided by the framework. Use
      `this.domElement` to access this container. The container is inside a
      modal rendered in the center of the page on top of a dark overlay.


      The render method is called once after the modal element is created and
      opened. It is recommended to use `onBeforeOpen()` for doing non-UI
      operations for your rendering that might take a long time. This will
      ensure that the framework can show a friendly UI such as a spinner to let
      the user know that the dialog is being prepared. If you choose to do your
      initialization or other costly operations inside render method, make sure
      to have a friendly UI so the user is informed about the state of your
      dialog. Otherwise, an empty element is shown to the user which is a bad
      user experience practice.
