    summary: A callback that is invoked immediately before the dialog receives focus.
    remarks: >-
      Provide this callback if there is a case when you want to abort showing the dialog before it's approved by the
      framework. For example, you can check if a long time has passed since the request was made or the the component
      requesting the dialog is disposed and you don't want to show the dialog anymore. It is important to keep this
      callback lightweight so the framework can resolve it quickly and the user interface does not have to wait a long
      time for it.
