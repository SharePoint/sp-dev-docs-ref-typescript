    summary: Indicates whether the property should be serialized as HTML.
    remarks: >-
      This flag instructs framework to store the value as HTML, so that SharePoint can perform the following services on
      it: - normalizing HTML encodings - stripping unsafe HTML tags (i.e. for usage with Element.innerHTML) - search
      indexing - SharePoint link fix-up


      Only enable this flag for HTML content where these modifications are acceptable. If non-HTML content is provided,
      SharePoint framework might make modifications to convert it to HTML valid. For plain text content that simply
      needs to be exposed to the search index (without any rewriting), use the isSearchablePlainText flag instead.

  - uid: sp-webpart-base.IWebPartPropertyMetadata.isImageSource
    summary: >-
      Indicates if the property contains a link. This allows SharePoint server to treat the value as such and perform
      services like link fix-up, search indexing, loading from CDN, etc.
    name: isImageSource
    fullName: sp-webpart-base.IWebPartPropertyMetadata.isImageSource

  - uid: sp-webpart-base.IWebPartPropertyMetadata.isSearchablePlainText
    summary: Indicates if the property contains plain text that should be search-indexed by SharePoint.
    remarks: >-
      This flag instructs the framework to store the property in a representation that supports search indexing. The
      content will be treated as plain text; SharePoint will not modify the string in any way, and special HTML
      characters may be stored encoded and appear in search results. If your string contains HTML markup, use the
      isHtmlString setting instead. Security note: For security reasons, never assign a plain text string to
      Element.innerHTML.
    name: isSearchablePlainText
    fullName: sp-webpart-base.IWebPartPropertyMetadata.isSearchablePlainText
    langs:
      - typeScript

        type:
          - boolean
  - uid: sp-webpart-base.IWebPartPropertyMetadata.shouldNotPersist
    summary: >-
      Indicates if the framework should persist the property on the server. Use this for properties that are only
      important in run-time, and do not need to persist on the server. This can reduce the size of the serialized data
      of the web part and optimize the webpart load time. The property value will be removed from the serialized data
      sent to the server, but this has no effect on the run-time property bag. The property value will still be
      available in onBeforeSerialize() method, and the value will not be cleared from the run-time property bag. The
      initial render of your web part should not depend on the value of the property. Setting a default value for the
      property can be done in onInit() method.


      Note that if the property path refers to a property that has a complex object as the value, the whole object will
      be removed from the persisted data.
