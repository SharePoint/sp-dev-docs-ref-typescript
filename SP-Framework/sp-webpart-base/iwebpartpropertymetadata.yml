    summary: 'If specified, indicates that the property is a dynamic property and the type of the dynamic property.'
    remarks: >-
      If a web part has properties that are dynamically configurable, then use this flag to declare the property as a
      dynamic property by specifying its type. When a property specifies its dynamic property type, then the framework
      ensures that its value can be accessed using 'tryGetValue' anytime in the life cycle of the web part. If a
      property is marked as DynamicProperty in the IWebPartProperties interface, but does not appear in the
      IWebPartPropertiesMetadata with a dynamicPropertyType, then the web part developer will need to manually create
      the DynamicProperty themselves and assign it to the property.


      A web part can configure a default value for the property by specifying it in the properties section of the web
      part's manifest. This value will be used when a dynamic property is constructed for the property.


      Note: Web parts should be able to type cast the resultant value from the `tryGetValue` to suit their needs.
