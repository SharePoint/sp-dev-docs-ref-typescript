fullName: BaseClientSideWebPart
summary: >-
  This abstract class implements the the base functionality for a client-side web part. Every client-side web part needs
  to inherit from this class.
remarks: >-
  Along with the base functionality, this class provides some APIs that can be used by the web part. These APIs fall in
  two catagories.


  The first category of APIs provide data and functionality. Example, the web part context (i.e. this.context). This API
  should be used to access contextual data relevant to this web part instance.


  The second category of APIs provide a base implementation for the web part lifecycle and can be overridden for an
  updated implementation. The render() API is the only API that is mandatory to be implemented/overridden by a web part.
  All other life cycle APIs have a base implementation and can be overridden based on the needs of the web part. Please
  refer to the documentation of the individual APIs to make the right decision.

    summary: Constructor for the BaseClientSideWebPart class.
    remarks: >-
      It is highly recommended that the web part use the `onInit()` API to perform any web part specific initialization.
      Most of the web part features like this.context and `this.properties` are not available to be used before the the
      `onInit()` part of the web part loading lifecycle.

    fullName: canOpenPopupOnRender
    summary: This property indicates whether a web part can open a popup on initial render.
    remarks: >-
      In some environments the host re-renders the web parts frequently, and therefore opening popups during render will
      cause popups to open repeatedly, which is a poor user experience. As an example, the classic SharePoint pages
      perform postbacks causing the page to re-render on all button clicks.


      If a web part needs to open a popup on render, it should use this API before opening the popup. If this API
      returns false, the web part should not open popup on initial render. Some web parts that open popups during render
      are the document embed web part that pops up the file picker on initial render, embedded video web part that pops
      up the PropertyPane on initial render.

      Child classes are expected to override this field by redeclaring it with a specialized type. It is meant to be a
      read-only property; the type cannot be declared as read-only in the base class (because it is initialized outside
      the constructor), but child classes should redeclare it as readonly.

    summary: This event method is called when the display mode of a web part is changed.
    remarks: >-
      The default implementation of this API calls the web part render method to re-render the web part with the new
      display mode. If a web part developer does not want a full re-render to happen on display mode change, they can
      override this API and perform specific updates to the web part DOM to switch its display mode.


      If the web part is initialized or re-initialized when switching to a different display mode then this lifecycle
      method is not called. Example: SharePoint Site Page.

      resources (i.e. DOM elements) that the web part is holding onto. This API is expected to be called in scenarios
      like page navigation i.e. the host is transitioning from one page to another and disposes the page that is being
