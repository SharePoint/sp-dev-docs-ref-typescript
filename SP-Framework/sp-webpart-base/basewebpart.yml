    remarks: >-
      The default implementation is a no-op. A web part developer can override this API if the deserialized object does
      not fully reflect the initial state of the property bag. This gives the web part developer a chance to populate
      the property bag right after the data is deserialized to an object.


      An important scenario to use deserialize is upgrading. An upgraded web part may load the data that was serialized
      by an older version of the web part that supported a different schema of the property bag, resulting the
      deserialized object to be incosistent with the current schema of the property bag. The developer can use
      `onAfterDeserialize` to check the dataVersion and fix the property bag.

      The default implementation is a no-op. The serialization process serializes the web part property bag i.e.
      this.properties. This API gives the web part a chance to update it's property bag before the serialization
      happens. Some web part's may keep their state other objects or even in the DOM. If a web part needs to persist
      some of that state, it needs to override this API and update the web part property bag to the latest state. If a
      web part updates the property bag with invalid property values, those will get persisted. So that should be
      avoided. The web part property bag should always contain valid property values.
