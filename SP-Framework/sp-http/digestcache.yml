summary: >-
  IDigestCache is an internal service used by SPHttpClient to maintain a cache
  of request digests for each SPWeb URL. A request digest is a security token
  that the SharePoint server requires for for any REST write operation,
  specified via the "X-RequestDigest" HTTP header. It is obtained by calling the
  "/\_api/contextinfo" REST endpoint, and expires after a server configurable
  amount of time.

  SharePoint 2013 REST endpoints"](<xref uid="https://msdn"

    summary: >-
      Inserts a specific request digest value into the cache. Normally this is
      unnecessary because the framework will automatically issue a REST request
      to fetch the digest when necessary; however, in advanced scenarios
      addDigestToCache() can be used to avoid the overhead of the REST call.

            fractional milliseconds; for example, to specify an expiration "5
            seconds from right now", use performance.now()+5000.

      digest, which will be added to the cache.
