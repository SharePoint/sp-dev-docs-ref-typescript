package: '@microsoft/sp-http!'
fullName: SPHttpClientBatch
summary: >-
  The SPHttpClientBatch class accumulates a number of REST service calls and
  transmits them as a single ODATA batch. This protocol is documented here:
  http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/odata-v4.0-part1-protocol.html


  The usage is to call SPHttpClientBatch.fetch() to queue each individual
  request, and then call SPHttpClientBatch.execute() to execute the batch
  operation. The execute() method returns a promise that resolves when the real
  REST call has completed. Each call to fetch() also returns a promise that will
  resolve with an SPHttpClientResponse object for that particular request.
remarks: >-
  The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should
  not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the
  `SPHttpClientBatch` class.

      The parameters for this function are basically the same as the WHATWG API
      standard documented here:


      [https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/)


      However, be aware that certain REST headers are ignored or not allowed
      inside a batch. See the ODATA documentation for details.


      When execute() is called, it will POST to a URL such as
      "http://example.com/sites/sample/\_api/$batch". Typically
      SPHttpClientBatch can successfully guess the appropriate SPWeb URL by
      looking for a reserved URL segment such as "\_api" in the first URL passed
      to fetch(). If not, use ISPHttpClientBatchCreationOptions.webUrl to
      specify it explicitly.
