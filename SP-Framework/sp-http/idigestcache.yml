summary: >-
  IDigestCache is an internal service used by SPHttpClient to maintain a cache
  of request digests for each SPWeb URL. A request digest is a security token
  that the SharePoint server requires for for any REST write operation,
  specified via the "X-RequestDigest" HTTP header. It is obtained by calling the
  "/\_api/contextinfo" REST endpoint, and expires after a server configurable
  amount of time.


  For more information, see the MSDN article ["Complete basic operations using
  SharePoint 2013 REST
  endpoints"](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj164022.aspx)

    summary: >-
      Inserts a specific request digest value into the cache. Normally this is
      unnecessary because the framework will automatically issue a REST request
      to fetch the digest when necessary; however, in advanced scenarios
      addDigestToCache() can be used to avoid the overhead of the REST call.

            The digest value, which is an opaque that must be generated by the
            SharePoint server. The syntax will look something like this:
            "0x0B85...2EAC,29 Jan 2016 01:23:45 -0000"
          type: string

          description: >-
            A future point in time, as measured by performance.now(), after
            which the digest value will no longer be valid. NOTE: The
            expirationTime is a DOMHighResTimeStamp value whose units are
            fractional milliseconds; for example, to specify an expiration "5
            seconds from right now", use performance.now()+5000.

      Returns a digest string for the specified SPWeb URL. If the cache already

      the promise will be pending and resolve after an HTTP request obtains the
      digest, which will be added to the cache.
