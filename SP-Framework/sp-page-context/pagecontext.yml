summary: The SharePoint page context object.
remarks: >-
  The page context provides standard definitions for common SharePoint objects that need to be shared between the
  client-side application, web parts, and other components. Typically the data is fetched via REST queries when
  navigating to a new page, but it can also be preloaded by the web server, or filled from a custom application cache.

    fullName: legacyPageContext
    summary: An object providing classic SharePoint properties that may be required by certain legacy scripts.
    remarks: >-
      This property is provided to facilitate migration of legacy code. It returns a JavaScript object whose contents
      are similar to the `_spPageContextInfo` window variable from classic pages. The contents of this variable may
      change in future releases of SharePoint. For this reason, new projects are encouraged to use the SharePoint
      Framework TypeScript APIs instead, since they are fully documented and provide reliable backwards compatibility
      guarantees.


      NOTE: If certain functionality is exposed in the `legacyPageContext` but does not seem to have a proper TypeScript
      API, please file an issue on GitHub. The intention is that no modern application should need to rely on the
      `legacyPageContext` object.
