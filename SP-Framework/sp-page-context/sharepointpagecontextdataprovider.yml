  The page context represents contextual information about the SharePoint page that is currently being viewed, such as
  its site URL, the client-side application ID, the current user, etc. The page context objects themselves represent key
  information that is needed e.g. to identify the site/web/list/listitem in a REST service call, but it is not a full
  cache with invalidation and change notifications.
