name: Page
uid: '@microsoft/sp-page-context!Page:class'
package: '@microsoft/sp-page-context!'
fullName: Page
summary: Exposes information that is associated with the SharePoint web page that is currently being displayed.
remarks: >-
  The Page object provides access to information that is scoped to the current SharePoint web page, but not stored with
  the underlying SPListItem. Note that the
  [PageContext.listItem](xref:@microsoft/sp-page-context!PageContext%23listItem:member) may be undefined for pages that
  are not based on a SharePoint list, whereas the PageContext.page will never be undefined.


  The concept of a "page" is subjective and defined by the router for a particular client-side application.


  The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or
  create subclasses that extend the `Page` class.

    summary: Returns true if the Social Bar is enabled.
    remarks: >-
      The Social Bar will appear on all modern SharePoint pages with the exception of the home page of a site. It will
      give users the ability to like a page, see the number of views, likes, and comments on a page, and see the people
      who have liked a page.
