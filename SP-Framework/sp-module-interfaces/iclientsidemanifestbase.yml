    summary: >-
      A universally unique component id. Each client-side component is required to have this id. Once an id has been
      used for a component, it cannot be changed. A change in this value is treated same as the creation of a new
      component. Two components are never expected to have the same id.


      Usage: Uniquely identify a client-side component.


      Supported values: a GUID string

      field is to help manage upgrades of the component manifest schema.
    remarks: >-
      A component developer needs to only confirm that they are using the correct value per the manifest schema. Please
      read the "manifest upgrade rules" for more details on when the schema could change. Note, manifest schema version
      upgrade will be considered a big API change event and will be advertised broadly.


      Usage: To help support multiple manifest schema versions.


      Supported values: A positive integer.
