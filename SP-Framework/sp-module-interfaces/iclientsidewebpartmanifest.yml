summary: >-
  The client-side SharePoint framework identifies a Web Part by its manifest.
  All Web Parts are expected to have a manifest.
remarks: >-
  The manifest is a schematized JSON blob that is used in multiple parts of the
  SharePoint infrastructure to identify, load and process a Web Part. The schema
  for this manifest is completely owned and versioned by Microsoft. There are
  some required properties in the manifest and some optional properties.
  Optional properties need to be provided only if the Web Part needs the
  specific functionality. An invalid manifest could lead to issues with Web Part
  loading and functionality problems.

      will not appear in the classic page web part gallery.

    remarks: >-
      Usage: Use this flag if it is not appropriate to display a web part in the
      modern toolbox. This property is not used in Classic SharePoint. By
      default, all web parts are enabled to be displayed in the toolbox. Such
      web parts can be provisioned on pages though API or be added to the page
      in a pre configured way.

    fullName: preconfiguredEntries
    summary: >-
      A Web Part can have pre-configured properties like the title, description,
      toolbox group name and Web Part specific custom properties. And there can
      be multiple instances of these pre-configured properties.
    remarks: >-
      This helps support scenarios where an organization may want to present
      multiple pre-configured entries for a Web Part in the Toolbox. Each entry
      is expected to configure the Web Part with a different set of
      pre-configured properties. A developer may decide to seed some initial
      values for these properties but an organization admin can go ahead and
      customize these properties per the needs of his/her organization. The
      properties can also be modified by the author of the page.


      Usage: help display a Web Part in the Toolbox, PropertyPane and the
      initial rendering of the Web Part.

      been tested as such. In this context, full bleed is a term used to denote
      that the web part takes the whole width of the containing page. Full bleed
      experiences require special treatment and testing. By default no web parts
      support full bleed experiences.

      variants experience.
    remarks: >-
      Usage: Use this flag if a web part supports theme variants and has been
      tested as such. In order to support theme variants, web parts must have
      the capability to render correctly in the context of a theme variant. A
      web part may or may not need to be updated to support theme variants, but
      should always be tested before enabling this flag. By default no web parts
      support theme variants.
